- Integration with their inventory management system
- Mobile-optimized checkout process
- Personalized product recommendations

## Results

- 50% reduction in cart abandonment rate
- 30% increase in average order value

Our client was able to successfully expand their business beyond their local market and compete with larger online retailers.
